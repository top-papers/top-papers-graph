\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Problem.} Fast-charging of Li-ion batteries is limited by degradation mechanisms such as lithium plating, especially under high current and unfavorable temperatures.

\textbf{Goal.} We study whether an AI agent pipeline can (i) synthesize literature into a structured evidence base, (ii) generate a testable hypothesis about a modified charging profile, and (iii) validate it via computational experiments.

\textbf{Contributions.} (1) A reproducible agentic workflow combining GraphRAG with structured multi-agent debate, (2) an expert-supervised checklist to reduce reasoning errors, and (3) a domain case study with simulation-based validation in PyBaMM.
